# PHP-CodeIgniter-Capstone

# Description

This web application is part of my capstone of the PHP Track during my training in Village88.
It is an E-commerce website where users can order products and the admin can manage the products and orders within the site.
It features Mady Bakehouse, a local bakehouse in Iloilo City, selling baked goods locally.
The original frontend design is by Jhaver Gurtiza from village88 and I'll have some few tweaks to it.
